22,1533,0,16,The proposed project redevelops a current brownfield and therefor restores a portion of the project site to a more desirable condition as well as retaining existing wildlife refuge. With the addition of the proposed park the quality of life will improve as it can be considered an amenity that will be a bright spot for the public.,0,2,The new facility will require a local workforce and therefor would hire locally to staff the facility.  This site could also be used as a cultural resource to provide educational opportunities for those in the community.,0,11,"While the proposed improvements will provide lighting, the lighting being emitted from the site would be substantially reduced from the existing conditions.  The site lighting will include directional lighting that conserves energy and reduces excessive glare. With the proposed lighting being a key design factor, the proposed improvements will use state of the art lighting.",0,14,The proposed improvements will include roadways and parks that will replace the existing brownfield.  The proposed roadways will allow for easier access and will potentially reduce local traffic by providing another route of travel. The proposed park will be a significant cultural resource for the public.,0,13,The existing site consist of unuseable space and an existing brownfield.  By redeveloping the existing site to include local roadways and a cultural resource park the site will be improved by all accounts.  The propose space will provide many different benefits that include educational and social meeting places.,0,4,"Through the use of best management practices and location of buffers, designated wetlands, and water bodies the existing wetlands and surface waters will be protected and cleaned.",1,0,The existing and proposed conditions do not relate to the preservation of floodplain functions.,0,9,Through the use of the local best management practices the site will be treated for the quantity and quality of the runoff from the site.
